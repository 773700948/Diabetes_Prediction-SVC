# Code Overview
## Importing Dependencies:

The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing, train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection, svm from sklearn, and accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.

## Data Collection and Analysis:

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv.

Basic data exploration is performed, including displaying the first few rows of the dataset, checking the shape of the dataset, and obtaining statistical measures using describe().

The distribution of the target variable (Outcome) is analyzed using value_counts().

## Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is split into features (X) and labels (Y).

The features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

## Train-Test Split:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split with a test size of 20% and stratified sampling based on the target variable.

## Model Training:

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel is initialized and trained on the training data.

## Model Evaluation:

The model's accuracy is evaluated on both the training and test datasets using accuracy_score.

## Making Predictions:

A predictive system is implemented where a new data point is standardized and passed to the trained model for prediction. The model predicts whether the person is diabetic or not.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Diabetes Dataset, which contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function.

Age: Age (years).

## Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the person is diabetic (1) or not (0).

# Key Points
Data Standardization: The features are standardized to ensure that the SVM model performs well, as SVM is sensitive to the scale of the input features.

Model Choice: SVM with a linear kernel is chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks, especially when the data is not too large.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, which is a common metric for classification tasks.

Example Prediction
The code includes an example where a new data point (5, 166, 72, 19, 175, 25.8, 0.587, 51) is used to predict whether the person is diabetic. The model predicts that the person is diabetic.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a typical workflow for a binary classification problem using machine learning. It covers data loading, exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The use of SVM with standardized data is a common approach for such tasks, and the code provides a clear example of how to implement this in Python.
